# Lab 8
In this lab, we will continue working on security. We will add users to our database, protect regions of our Angular application and our API. Then, we will build on our Dependency Injection lecture by adding some logging to our application. Finally, we will combine Security and DI to do some custom authorization handling. 

##Exercise 1: Add Sample Account to our database
##Exercise 2: Protecting Angular Components
##Exercise 3: Protecting our API
##Exercise 4: General Logging
##Exercise 5: Authorization Handler
